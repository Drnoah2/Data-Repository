## Introduction
---
This project presents a Hotel Performance Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to provide an overview of hotel booking patterns, guest demographics and operational efficencies, in order to maximize revenue.


---
## Problem Statement
---
Hotel management faces challenges in:
- Tracking overall revenue performance over time
-	Identifying top-performing markets and countries
-	Understanding guest demographics and booking patterns
-	Monitoring pricing effectiveness (ADR) and booking demand
Without a centralized analytical view, decision-making becomes reactive rather than proactive.
This project aims to solve this by transforming raw hotel booking data into an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard.


---
## Data Sourcing
---
The data was sourced as structured tables from google spreadsheet in an excel file format and imported into Power BI Desktop for analysis.
